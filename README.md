NOTE: This was a class project, built on a deadline. Technical debt exists.

Okay, C# fans... So, this is basically an XNA 4 wrapper library, including a functioning game project.

Tested to build/work in Visual C# Express 2010.

If you don't have XNA installed, download the Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 library here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914

Remember, this was a homework assignment that I crushed-out in a short period of time, not a professional project. Although, having worked in the games industry since I wrote this, I realize that sometimes "professional" games look more like this homework than we want to admit.
